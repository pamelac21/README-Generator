## Description
   I wanted to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.
   I built this project so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.
        
        
        

## Installation
 Using node.js, install inquirer by running: npm i inquirer

## Usage
 Answer the questions in the command line to generate a README file.
